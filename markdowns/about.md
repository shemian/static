# A Guide to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text on the web. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz and has since become a popular way to create rich text content.

## Images

Here's an example of how to add an image to a markdown file:

![MarineGEO circle logo](../assets/images/1.jpg "MarineGEO logo")

Make sure to provide a description for the image in the "alt text" field.

## URLs

Links can be added to markdown files by using the following syntax:

[Link Text](https://www.example.com)

## Videos

Markdown does not have built-in support for videos, but you can embed videos from websites like YouTube using the following syntax:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">
   <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/0.jpg" alt="Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up" width="240" height="180" border="10" />
</a>

And that's it! With these basic features, you can create rich and formatted text content using Markdown.
